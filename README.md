An Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm tasked with training a quadcopter to take off and move towards a z postion (vertical) of 10 meters while moving in the x and y coordinates as little as possible. The algorithm used deep fully connected neural networks to simulate q-learning in a 3 dimensional continuous task.

This model was trained over 1000 episodes with increasing success as demonstrated in the second graph above, which plots the rewards earned by the quadcopter as it acts in its enviornment.
